 * Simple polling mouse state.

 * This has an advantage of offering smooth scrolling (if polled every render tick it will return scroll events
 * appropriately). Unfortunately, it doesn't always play well with other mods: clicks handled by other mods will also be
 * reported which sometimes leads to issues, see:
 * - https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/issues/2
